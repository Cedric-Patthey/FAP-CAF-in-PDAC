-   **Musmu_GRCm39_Ens109_26Feb2024.Rmd**

    Preparation of reference genome from GRCm39 assembly with Ensembl 109 realease annotation. Includes making of protein coding gtf and bed annotation files, STAR mappable genome and CellRanger mappable genome directory.

-   **Human_mouse_orthology_table_26Nov2019.Rmd**

    Generation of a Mouse-human orthology table based on Ensembl gene trees

## Acessory files (metadata)
