# SmartSeq2_bulk_RNAseq_read_count_pipeline

Code used in the bulk RNA-seq pipeline.

-   **SS2_SE_FASTQ2RRC.Rmd**

    The code as it was used on Rackham at UPPMAX to process fastq files to a read count table for the bulk RNA-seq experiments. This pipeline requires the scripts `fastq2RRC.sh`, `symplicity.py`, `get_cdna_pos.py` and `get_fastq_not_from_id_list.py` available in the pipeline directory.
